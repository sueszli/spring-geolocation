# Handling Geolocation data in Spring-Boot âœ¨

A colleague created a small mobile app prototype to handle locations and you are asked to provide a backend application for it.

Create a REST API that handles locations.

If requests come with a payload, the API should accept a json and should return a json as well, if a response is required.

- Provide a git repository.
- Write a working solution in Java. 
- Use any library, framework and tools you think fits the purpose.
- Please try to write clean code with a good design. 
- Add a bit of documentation that outlines the solution and explains on how to build and run the code. 
- (Optionally) provide a docker file or similar to create one or more containers running your application.

### CREATE: Create a Location

It should be possible to create a new location by providing a `name`, a `type` with possible values `premium` or `standard`
and coordinates using `lat` and `lng`.

The system has to assign the location an `id` and return it back within the response.

Here some example values to create a location:

```json
{
  "name": "Fancy Place",
  "lat": 48.2,
  "lng": 15.6,
  "type": "premium"
}
```

### SEARCH: Search for a Location

It should be possible to search for locations based on `type` or by defining a rectangular area with two points `p1`, `p2`
(`lat`,`lng`) and returning all locations within it.

It is also possible to use both criteria together and the result set might be limited by `limit`.

Results must be ordered by type where `premium` ones come first.

Here is an example to search for a location:

```json
{
    "type": "premium",
    "p1": {
        "lat": 46.6,
        "lng": 15.4
    },
    "p2": {
        "lat": 48.8,
        "lng": 17.5
    },
    "limit": 3
}
```

Received Feedback:
Good:
- Working code with pagination.
- Reasonable technology choices.
- Mostly leveraged framework capabilities.

Bad:
- API-Design:
  - GET method should not have a request body.
  - No default limit leads to loading of the whole database into memory in case no limit is given.
- Tests:
  - Testcases always use random input for single run, this is in our opinion an anti-pattern.
  - No unit-tests implemented. Instead, integration tests on web controller level are labeled as unit tests.
